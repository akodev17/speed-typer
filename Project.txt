Project: Speed Typer

This project is a web application that allows users to test their typing speed by typing a quote. The application will keep track of the user's accuracy and speed, and will display the results in real-time. The application will also include a timer that will start when the user starts typing and will stop when the user finishes typing the quote. The timer will be displayed in the top right corner of the screen. The application will also include a display of the quote that the user is typing, and will highlight any incorrect characters that the user types. The application will also include a text input box where the user can type the quote. The application will also include a button that the user can click on to start the timer and start typing the quote. The application will also include a button that the user can click on to stop the timer and stop typing the quote. The application will also include a button that the user can click on to reset the timer and start over. The application will also include a button that the user can click on to get a new quote and start over.
